For Practice During the College Break

I am practicing that i learned last semester from college. I'm trying to make an F1 website. I'm applying what I learned at College last semester. I'm currently working on HTML AND CSS. After the HTML AND CSS section is finished, I plan to add javascript and instant weather for F1 tracks. I'm still working on it, the project is not finished yet.

Estimated project completion date is 6 MAY 2024.![Curently](https://github.com/23Soap/f1-project/assets/50261583/b73211d3-931e-47c5-b644-889592d78681)
